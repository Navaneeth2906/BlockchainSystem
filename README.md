# BlockchainSystem

<p> To gain a practical understanding of Blockchain technology, I designed a Blockchain System in Python. </p>
<p> This involved coding classes with methods for creating key pairs, for creating signed transactions, 
and for creating blocks from those transactions to add to a blockchain. </p>
<p> For all nodes to maintain an up-to-date copy of the blockchain I then implemented a P2P network. </p>
<p> A toJson method is used to help view the blockchain in a readable format on a browser. </p>
<p> A Proof of Stake consensus algorithm randomly decides which node will be the next forger giving more weighting to nodes that staked more tokens. </p>
<p> Instructions to run the program are in the Main.py file. </p>
