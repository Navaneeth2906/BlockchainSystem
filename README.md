# BlockchainSystem

<p> This Blockchain System is a model to help gain a better understanding of Blockchain Technology. </p>
<p> There are classes with methods for creating key pairs, for creating signed transactions, 
and for creating blocks from those transactions to add to a blockchain. </p>
<p> For all nodes to maintain an up-to-date copy of the blockchain a P2P network is implemented. </p>
<p> The blockchain can be viewed in a readable format on a braswer via a toJson method. </p>
<p> A Proof of Stake consensus algorithm randomly decides which node will be the next forger giving more weighting to nodes that staked more tokens. </p>
<p> Instructions to run the program are in the Main.py file. </p>
